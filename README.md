# Max-Jitter
Max Jitter tools for video mapping.

Here are some tools I created in Max Jitter. They should work from Max 6 on Windows and Mac. 
I used only native Max objects and JavaScript. The JavaScript objects have pattrstorage support. 
Since I switched to a different programming environment for video stuff, I won't develope them any further. 
But maybe they are a good starting point for someone else.


Masking

This is a masking tool, that allows drawing arbitrary vector shapes using the jit.mgraphics object.


Warping

This is a gui element for the jit.gl.nurbs object, that allows easy texture warping.


Keystone

This is a gui element for the jit.gl.cornerpin object.
