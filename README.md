<h2> Tools for video mapping. </h2>

Here are some tools I created in Max Jitter. They should work from Max 6 on Windows and Mac. \n
I used only native Max objects and JavaScript. The JavaScript objects have pattrstorage support. 


<h2> Masking </h2>

This is a masking tool, that allows drawing arbitrary vector shapes using the jit.mgraphics object.


<h2> Warping </h2>

<h2> Keystone </h2>
